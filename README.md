## How to play

We Maze! is multiplayer (unless you are crazy and want to control both players at the same time =):
- Player 1 always turns right unless the left key is being pressed.
- Player 2 always turns left unless the right key is being pressed.

Annoying cars, subway stations and moving buildings are waiting for you!
